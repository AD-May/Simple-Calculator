![An image of the calculator rendered on the webpage.](Calc-Image.png)

While simple in its design, this calculator was an opportunity to refresh my skills in regular expression handling, working with ```localStorage```, and DOM manipulation in Javascript.
Some functionalities the calculator includes are:
  - Adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing on the basic input line as well as with a string stored to local memory
  * Calculating the absolute value of a number
  + Adding decimals with up to 3 values after
  - Switching the sign of a number from positive to negative or the other way around
  * The ability to clear the input line or clear all content (input line, memory, and localstorage)

# To-Do
